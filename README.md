# Advent of Code Solutions

Repository containing my [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) Solutions written in Rust.

### Usage

```
Usage: aoc_rust <COMMAND>

Commands:
  test    Test solution with example input
  run     Run solution using real input
  time    Benchmark solution time
  list    List all implemented solutions (defaults list all solutions)
  create  Create directory containing templates for a new year

```


### Notes
- Before using for the first time, find your [session cookie](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1) and put it in the .env file at the root of the project, otherwise automatic input fetching will not work
- README will eventually contain tables containing benchmarks for each solution by year
