# Advent of Code Solutions

Repository containing my [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) Solutions written in Rust.

### Usage

```
Usage: aoc_rust <COMMAND>

Commands:
  test    Test solution with example input
  run     Run solution using real input
  time    Benchmark solution time
  list    List all implemented solutions (defaults list all solutions)
  create  Create directory containing templates for a new year
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version

### Notes
- Automatic fetching of puzzle inputs doesn't work yet, use the ```test``` subcommand for now until fetching is implemented
- README will eventually contain tables containing benchmarks for each solution by year
